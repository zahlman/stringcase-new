## v1.2.3

* `alphanumcase` is fixed to work in Python 3, following the [change to the behaviour of `filter`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13638898). Thanks to [flou](https://github.com/flou) for the contribution, cherry-picked from the old repository.

## v1.2.2

This is the first release of `stringcase-new`; version numbers are intended to follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) in general, but are starting here for continuity with the original project. (Version 1.2.1 has been skipped - recognizing that the original author appears to have intended to make that release but never did.)
